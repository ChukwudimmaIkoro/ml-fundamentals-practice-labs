# K-Means Customer Segmentation – Learning Lab

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating **K-Means clustering**
for customer segmentation using Python. The notebook follows a guided learning
lab and focuses on applying unsupervised learning to group data points based on
similarity.

## What I practiced
- Applying K-Means clustering to a dataset
- Choosing the number of clusters
- Assigning data points to clusters
- Analyzing cluster groupings
- Visualizing clustering results

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes on provenance
This notebook is adapted from an instructional learning lab.
I completed the exercises independently and made light documentation
edits for clarity.

## How to run locally
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
jupyter notebook
