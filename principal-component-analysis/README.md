# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – Learning Lab

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of
**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction using Python.
The notebook follows a guided learning lab and focuses on transforming data
into a lower-dimensional representation.

## What I practiced
- Applying PCA to reduce dimensionality
- Interpreting principal components
- Examining explained variance
- Visualizing data in lower dimensions
- Understanding tradeoffs between dimensionality and information retention

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes on provenance
This notebook is adapted from an instructional learning lab.
I completed the exercises independently and made light documentation
edits for clarity.

## How to run locally
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
jupyter notebook
