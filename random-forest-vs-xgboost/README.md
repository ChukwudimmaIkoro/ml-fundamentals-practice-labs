This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of
**Random Forests** and **XGBoost** for classification using Python.
The notebook follows a guided learning lab and focuses on training
and evaluating tree-based ensemble models.

## What I practiced
- Training Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers
- Working with tree-based ensemble models
- Using a train/test split for model evaluation
- Making predictions on unseen data
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes on provenance
This notebook is adapted from an instructional learning lab.
I completed the exercises independently and made light documentation
edits for clarity.

## How to run locally
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost
jupyter notebook
