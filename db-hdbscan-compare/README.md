# DBSCAN & HDBSCAN – Learning Lab

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of
**DBSCAN** and **HDBSCAN** for density-based clustering using Python.
The notebook follows a guided learning lab and focuses on comparing
how the two algorithms group data points.

## What I practiced
- Applying DBSCAN clustering to a dataset
- Applying HDBSCAN clustering to the same dataset
- Comparing clustering results between DBSCAN and HDBSCAN
- Identifying noise and outliers in data
- Visualizing clustering outputs

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- HDBSCAN
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes on provenance
This notebook is adapted from an instructional learning lab.
I completed the exercises independently and made light documentation
edits for clarity.

## How to run locally
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn hdbscan matplotlib
jupyter notebook
