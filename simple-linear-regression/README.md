# Simple Linear Regression – Learning Lab

This repository contains a cleaned and refactored notebook demonstrating **Simple Linear Regression**
using Python. The work is based on an instructional lab and has been organized for clarity and
GitHub presentation.

## What I practiced
- Understanding linear relationships between variables
- Fitting a simple linear regression model
- Interpreting model coefficients and predictions
- Working with Jupyter notebooks for data analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes on provenance
This notebook is adapted from a guided learning lab. I completed the exercises independently and
cleaned the code, comments, and structure to reflect my understanding.

## How to run locally
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
jupyter notebook
```

Then open `simple-linear-regression-github.ipynb`.

## Extension beyond the lab
In addition to the core lab steps, I added:
- Quantitative evaluation on a held-out test set (MSE and R²)
- Residual analysis for diagnostic insight
- A summary of practical takeaways
- Followed a standard train/test workflow with consolidated model training,
  prediction, and evaluation for clarity
