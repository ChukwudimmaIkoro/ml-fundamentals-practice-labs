# Multiple Linear Regression – Learning Lab

This repository contains a cleaned and enhanced Jupyter notebook demonstrating
**Multiple Linear Regression** in Python. The work is based on a guided instructional
lab and has been extended for clarity, evaluation, and GitHub presentation.

## What I practiced
- Training a multiple linear regression model
- Interpreting coefficients across multiple features
- Making predictions using trained models
- Evaluating regression performance with standard metrics
- Diagnosing model behavior using residual analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Extension beyond the original lab
In addition to the core lab steps, I added:
- Quantitative model evaluation (MSE and R²)
- Residual diagnostics
- A summary of key modeling takeaways
- Evaluation performed on a held-out test set to assess generalization

## Notes on provenance
This notebook is adapted from an instructional learning lab.
I completed the exercises independently and refactored the notebook
structure, documentation, and evaluation steps to reflect my understanding.

## How to run locally
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
jupyter notebook
