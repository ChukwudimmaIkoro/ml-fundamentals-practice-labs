# Titanic Survival Prediction – Practice Project

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for a **Titanic survival prediction**
practice project. The notebook follows a guided learning lab and applies
basic data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict passenger
survival based on available features.

## Project overview
Using the Titanic dataset, this project explores relationships between
passenger attributes and survival outcomes, and builds a simple predictive
model to estimate survival likelihood.

## What I practiced
- Exploring and preprocessing a real-world dataset
- Selecting relevant features for prediction
- Training a machine learning model for binary classification
- Evaluating model performance using basic metrics
- Interpreting results in the context of the dataset

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes on provenance
This notebook is adapted from an instructional learning lab provided by
IBM. I completed the exercises independently and made light documentation
edits for clarity and understanding.

## How to run locally
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
jupyter notebook
