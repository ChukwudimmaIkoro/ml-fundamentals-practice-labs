# KNN Classification – Learning Lab

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating a basic
**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification workflow using Python and scikit-learn.
The notebook is based on a guided learning lab and includes a small,
intentional evaluation step for context.

## What I practiced
- Training a KNN classifier
- Working with train/test splits
- Making predictions on unseen data
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy
- Interpreting classification results with a confusion matrix

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes on provenance
This notebook is adapted from an instructional learning lab.
I completed the exercises independently and added light documentation
and evaluation steps to reflect my understanding.

## How to run locally
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
jupyter notebook
